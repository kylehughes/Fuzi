This skill should be used when choosing between actor, class, or MainActor for state management, when questioning whether an actor is the right concurrency primitive, or when actors are being considered solely to fix compiler diagnostics.

# Deciding When to Use Swift Actors

Apply these decision criteria when considering whether to introduce a custom actor into a Swift codebase.

## The Actor Decision Test

An actor is appropriate **only** when all three conditions are met:

1. **Non-Sendable state** - The type holds thread-unsafe data that requires protection
2. **Atomic mutations required** - Operations on that state must be atomic
3. **Cannot run on MainActor** - The work genuinely cannot be performed on the main thread

If any condition is missing, use a different approach.

## Decision Matrix

| Situation | Recommended Approach |
|-----------|---------------------|
| Shared state tied to UI | `@MainActor` class |
| Shared state, all Sendable | Class (no actor needed) |
| State needs synchronous access | Class with explicit synchronization |
| Truly concurrent, non-Sendable state | Custom actor |
| "Network client" with no non-Sendable state | `@MainActor` class with `async let` or `@concurrent` |

## Common Anti-Patterns

### Using Actors to Silence Diagnostics

Never introduce an actor solely to fix a concurrency diagnostic that is not understood. This reinforces incorrect mental models and often leads to fundamentally flawed system designs.

Every custom actor should be justifiable with: "This is an actor because it has non-Sendable state requiring atomic mutations that cannot run on MainActor."

### Empty Protection Actors

A "network client" actor containing zero non-Sendable state misuses actors. The pattern exists because actors happen to run off the main thread, but this creates artificial limitations:

- Cannot perform synchronous work concurrently (like decoding responses)
- Adds unnecessary complexity

**Better**: Use a `@MainActor` class with `async let` or `@concurrent` functions for parallel work.

## Synchronous Access Consideration

Actors do not support synchronous external access. Before choosing an actor, ask:

- Can the rest of the system tolerate asynchronous access to this state?
- Will any code path need synchronous reads or writes?

If synchronous access is required, an actor is not viable.

## The MainActor Default

Every Swift program includes `MainActor`, which already manages enormous amounts of state. For UI-connected state, `@MainActor` is usually the right choice because:

- State is fundamentally tied to UI
- Synchronous access from main thread is often needed
- Simpler mental model than custom isolation domains

## Reference: Value vs Reference Type Selection

Before reaching actor vs class, first determine if a reference type is needed at all:

- **Value type** (struct/enum): When each consumer should have its own copy
- **Reference type** (class/actor): When multiple consumers must share a single source of truth

Choose a class when sharing state without special isolation requirements. Choose an actor only when the three-condition test passes.

## Mental Model: Actors as Remote Services

Think of actors as remote network services:

- Data is physically inaccessible except through requests
- Inputs and outputs must be packaged (Sendable)
- Other requests can happen simultaneously
- All interaction is asynchronous

This metaphor clarifies why synchronous access is impossible and why Sendable boundaries matter.
