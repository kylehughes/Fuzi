# Understanding Swift Concurrency Terms

This skill provides definitions and context for Swift Concurrency vocabulary. Use it to look up keywords, annotations, protocols, and concepts when working with Swift's structured concurrency system.

## Quick Reference by Category

| `async let` | Begin async work without immediate await |
| `for-await` | Iterate over AsyncSequence values |

## Detailed Definitions

### actor (Keyword)

Defines a reference type that protects mutable state. Actors are the fundamental unit of isolation in Swift Concurrency.

```swift
actor Counter {
    private var value = 0
    func increment() { value += 1 }
}
```

**Introduced**: SE-0306 Actors

### Actor (Protocol)

Protocol that all actor types automatically conform to. Similar to `AnyObject` for classes. Primarily used for creating isolated parameters.

**Introduced**: SE-0306 Actors

### async / await (Keywords)

`async` marks a function that can suspend. `await` marks suspension points where the executing actor may change.

```swift
func fetchData() async -> Data {
    await networkRequest()  // suspension point
}
```

**Introduced**: SE-0296 Async/await

### async let (Flow Control)

Begin asynchronous work without immediately awaiting the result. Useful for parallelizing slow operations.

```swift
async let image = downloadImage()
async let metadata = fetchMetadata()
let result = await (image, metadata)
```

**Introduced**: SE-0317 async let bindings

### AsyncSequence (Protocol)

A sequence whose values become available over time. Use `for-await` to consume.

```swift
for await value in asyncStream {
    process(value)
}
```

**Introduced**: SE-0298 Async/Await: Sequences

### @concurrent (Annotation)

Forces an async function to run on the global executor rather than inheriting caller isolation. Required in Swift 6.2+ when `nonisolated async` functions inherit caller isolation by default.

```swift
@concurrent
func backgroundWork() async { }
```

**Introduced**: SE-0461

### Continuations

APIs for wrapping callback-based code into async functions:
- `withCheckedContinuation` / `withCheckedThrowingContinuation`
- `withUnsafeContinuation` / `withUnsafeThrowingContinuation`

```swift
func wrapped() async -> Result {
    await withCheckedContinuation { continuation in
        legacyAPI { result in
            continuation.resume(returning: result)
        }
    }
}
```

**Introduced**: SE-0300

### Default Isolation (Concept)

All declarations have a defined static isolation. Prior to Swift 6.2, the default was `nonisolated`. Swift 6.2 allows changing the default to `MainActor`, creating a language dialect where code semantics depend on this setting.

**Introduced**: SE-0466

### Executor (Protocol)

Controls how actors execute their code. Rarely needed for typical development but available for advanced performance tuning.

**Introduced**: SE-0304

### Global Executor (Concept)

The executor for concurrent (non-actor-isolated) code. Unlike actor executors, it runs multiple things simultaneously. Code reaches it via `async let`, `TaskGroup`, or `@concurrent`.

**Introduced**: SE-0338

### @globalActor (Annotation)

Makes an actor type usable as an annotation for applying static isolation.

```swift
@globalActor
actor MyGlobalActor {
    static let shared = MyGlobalActor()
}

@MyGlobalActor
func isolatedFunction() { }
```

**Introduced**: SE-0316

### isolated (Keyword)

Defines static isolation through a function parameter. The most powerful but complex isolation mechanism.

```swift
func process(on actor: isolated MyActor) {
    // runs isolated to the passed actor
}
```

**Introduced**: SE-0313

### #isolation (Macro)

Returns the static isolation as `(any Actor)?`. Useful with isolated parameters or debugging.

```swift
print(#isolation)  // prints current isolation context
```

**Introduced**: SE-0420

### @isolated(any) (Annotation)

Enables runtime inspection of a function variable's static isolation. Often paired with `@_inheritActorContext`.

**Introduced**: SE-0431

### Isolation (Concept)

The abstraction over thread-safety that actors provide. Actors implement isolation, often via serial queues internally.

### @_inheritActorContext (Annotation)

Applies isolation inheritance to closure parameters, matching Task semantics.

```swift
func runLater(@_inheritActorContext operation: @escaping () async -> Void) { }
```

**Note**: Underscored attribute; formalization pending.

### @MainActor (Annotation)

References the shared MainActor instance. The most common global actor annotation.

```swift
@MainActor
class ViewController { }
```

**Introduced**: SE-0316

### nonisolated (Keyword)

Explicitly disables actor isolation for a declaration. Useful for running code off an actor.

```swift
actor MyActor {
    nonisolated func utility() -> String { "safe" }
}
```

**Introduced**: SE-0313

### nonisolated(nonsending) (Annotation)

Makes an async function inherit the caller's isolation. Avoids Sendable requirements. Settings-independent alternative to default isolation inheritance.

**Introduced**: SE-0461

### nonisolated(unsafe) (Annotation)

Opts a declaration out of Sendable checking. More targeted than `@unchecked Sendable` or preconcurrency imports.

**Introduced**: SE-0306

### @preconcurrency (Attribute)

Manages compatibility between Swift 6 concurrency code and pre-Swift 6 code. Essential for consuming or producing APIs across Swift versions.

**Introduced**: SE-0337, SE-0423

### Region-Based Isolation (Concept)

Compiler analysis that relaxes Sendable requirements when usage patterns are provably safe within a function body. The `sending` keyword extends this power across function boundaries.

**Introduced**: SE-0414

### Sendable (Protocol)

Marker protocol indicating a type is safe to use across any isolation domain. Has no members but significant implications.

```swift
struct Point: Sendable {
    let x: Int
    let y: Int
}
```

**Introduced**: SE-0302

### SendableMetatype (Protocol)

Marker indicating a metatype is safe across isolation. Required after Swift 6.2 introduced isolated conformances.

**Introduced**: SE-0470

### @Sendable (Attribute)

The Sendable equivalent for function types (since functions cannot conform to protocols).

```swift
let closure: @Sendable () -> Void = { }
```

**Introduced**: SE-0302

### sending (Keyword)

Expresses concurrent usage constraints in function signatures. Relaxes Sendable requirements by encoding behavior promises.

```swift
func transfer(sending value: NonSendableType) { }
```

**Introduced**: SE-0430

### Task (Type)

Creates a top-level context for running async code. Supports cancellation, priority, and result access.

```swift
Task {
    await doWork()
}
```

**Introduced**: SE-0304

### TaskGroup (Type)

Manages multiple child tasks for parallel execution.

```swift
await withTaskGroup(of: Result.self) { group in
    for item in items {
        group.addTask { await process(item) }
    }
}
```

**Introduced**: SE-0304

### TaskLocal (Type)

Task-scoped value storage, analogous to thread-local values.

```swift
enum RequestContext {
    @TaskLocal static var id: String?
}
```

**Introduced**: SE-0311

### @unchecked (Annotation)

Disables compiler verification for a Sendable conformance. Use when thread-safety is implemented through mechanisms the compiler cannot verify.

```swift
class ThreadSafeCache: @unchecked Sendable {
    private let lock = NSLock()
    // ...
}
```

**Introduced**: SE-0302
